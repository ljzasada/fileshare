- Search fields are automatically filled out with the subject's information during a traffic stop, so all you have to do is press a button!

**Troubleshooting**
- If your mouse does not appear in Computer+, then make sure the display resolution in game matches your windows display resolution. If the resolutions do not match, you will not see a mouse cursor
- If you play in windows or windows borderless mode, make sure to keep your mouse inside of the game window until the game fully loads

**Planned Improvements**
- Integration with Albo1125's British Policing Script.
- Combining Computer+ and fiskey111's LSPDFR PolicingMDT into one mod.

**Installation**
Place ComputerPlus.dll, ComputerPlus.ini and the ComputerPlus folder in Plugins\LSPDFR\.
LSPDFR will automatically load Computer+ when you go on duty.

**Usage**
While in a stationary police vehicle, hold E or the Right D-Pad button to bring up Computer+.

**Configuration**
If you open the ComputerPlus.ini file, you will notice a few things.
You can change the username and/or password that is displayed on the login screen to anything you want.
You can also adjust which backgrounds are shown for which vehicles.
To give an additional police vehicle a background, simply add another entry in the format vehiclename:bgfile.jpg
ENSURE THAT THE VEHICLE YOU'RE ADDING IS A POLICE VEHICLE AND THE BACKGROUND FILE IS IN .JPG FORMAT.

**Additional Info**
Computer+ DOES NOT replace the default LSPDFR computer.
So, if you don't always want to use Computer+ during your patrols, then you need not worry - the default computer is still there.
