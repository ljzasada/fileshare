1.1.0.0

RPH 52. Works with RPH 51 or higher.
GTAV 1.0.1011-1.0.1032.1.
Added support for VocalDispatch 1.6.0.0.
Added sound duration option to config/PanicButton.ini to further support custom panic button sounds not overlapping.
Reduced the default number of panic button units.
Fixed a bug where too many swat units were being called in the panic button logic.
(Hopefully) fixed a bug where the plate checker crashed when called on a trailer (please let me know if you have more issues).
Ensured setting 'AlwaysDisplayButtons=true' in GeneralConfig.ini reduces some extra CPU load for low specced PCs.
You only need to update PoliceSmartRadio.dll and Config/PanicButton.ini if updating from 1.0.0.0.
